# Setup

The developer toolkit is ready to use out of the box. You can deploy the whole [System architecture](../../system-architecture/) to your local machine by running a couple of Hardhat tasks.

Start the setup process by installing the Hardhat shorthand, adjusting the environment variables and setting up the Stacktical config:

{% page-ref page="hardhat-shorthand-hh.md" %}

{% page-ref page="environment.md" %}

{% page-ref page="setup-networks/" %}

Once you finish the setup, you can use it to run tasks for Developers or Chainlink node operators:

{% page-ref page="../developer/" %}

{% page-ref page="../node-operator/" %}
