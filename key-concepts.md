# Key concepts

DSLA protocol is a smart-contract based protocol to automate service level agreements \(SLA\) **of any kind.** This ****agreements are designed with the purpose of align incentives of the different stake holders, like service providers and users, Chainlink node operators and developers.

As simple as create a REST api with Express.js, any developer  can create a new use case and register it in the DSLA protocol to be used by anyone.

In order to achieve that, DSLA protocol makes use of Chainlink architecture as oracles for our service level agreements. This oracles are responsible of collecting data from the real world, and transform them into an SLI \(service level index\) so the SLA \(service level agreement\)
